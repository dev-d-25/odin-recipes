    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Spaghetti Carbonara is a traditional Roman pasta dish made with a few
      simple ingredients: eggs, cheese, pancetta, and pepper. Creamy without
      using cream, this quick dish is rich, savory, and incredibly satisfying —
      a perfect example of Italian culinary simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This recipe combines freshly cooked spaghetti with crispy pancetta and a
      silky sauce made from eggs and Parmesan. Tossed together while still hot,
      the pasta becomes coated in a creamy, cheesy mixture that clings to each
      strand without overwhelming it.
